Using frequency analysis I calculated the most likely initial substitutions. These were the punctuation bar "|" and the letter "E". I also made the most likely substitutions for the rest of the alphabet but the bar "|" and the letter "E" would most likely be correct, the others would need some work done to them.

I was having troubles replacing all the characters at the same time as replacing them in a for loop sometimes overrides other values. I found a method online that replaced all characters in one go and used that to help me. Credit for this method goes to Carl Smith

Once I had made these substitutions I knew where each word started and stopped thanks to the bar character. I split the text into each word and found the most common words in the list. I did the same for Tess27 (the plain text file). I then made an assumption that the most common word in the cipher text was the most common word in the plain text, "THE". I was reassured that the letter was the because the third letter had already been converted to "E" in the first batch of replacements.

I repeated this process for the most common words until I started to understand some English words. I then made educated guesses on what the most likely substitutions would be, using the frequency analysis' and excluding the letters I already knew were correct.

Finally I archived what looked correct and checked that it exists in the file Tess27. It did.
