Check the letter frequency for each letter in the cipher text. Break the cipher text into 6 sections, one for every sixth letter starting at the first to sixth letter. Perform letter frequency analysis on each of the sections. It's likely that the key is the amount of steps from the cipher text's most frequent letter to each sections most frequent letter. Move each section the amount of steps that the frequent letter moved. This failed so I needed to move one letter to the second most frequent letter.
