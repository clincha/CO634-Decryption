This assessment comprises seven exercises, unimaginatively called Exercise 1 to
Exercise 7. For each exercise you will be given an extract from Thomas Hardy's
novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles (first published in 1891), encrypted with one of the
ciphers we discussed earlier in the course. Your job is to decrypt the extract, recovering
the plaintext. In each exercise, every student will be given a different extract to decipher,
and the encryption key will vary from student to student; however, all the extracts within
a particular exercise will be encoded with the same sort of cipher, as described below.
For example, in Exercise 1 everyone will have an extract encoded with a Caesar cipher.
You are free to work with colleagues in devising methods for decrypting particular sorts
of cipher, and in putting together programs to help you do so; however, when it comes
to decrypting your own individual pieces of ciphertext, you must work individually,
without help from anyone else.
Brute-force methods are not ruled out; however, you may find the assessment more
rewarding if you introduce an analytical component into your decryption tactics.
